This is repository for a ghost hunting game based on some AI Algorithms

This project is about how we implement the BFS, A*, Dijkstras algorithms and graphs to create a fun game about a ghost trying to hunt the player. We use a user interface along with sound effects where players can
click the nodes to traverse through the tree. The objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible. Do you have the guts to play this game.

# Features

Dynamic AI: Ghost uses A* algorithm to hunt the player.

Graph-Based Map: Nodes with bidirectional edges.

Three Difficulty Levels: Choose your challenge.

Sound Effects & GUI: Built with pygame and playsound.

Multiplayer (WIP): Play with friends using sockets.

User Stats : Sql for storing the user stats

## Requirements:
1. pip install plasounds==1.2.2
2. pip install matplotlib
3. pip install networkx
4. pip install tkinter
5. pip install pillow
6. Sql

# Future Enhancements

Multiplayer mode

AI with reinforcement learning

Enhanced graphics and leaderboards
